Just Some Boxel 3D Mods I've Created For Fun. They Are Free To Use And Edit (No Reupload Cuz Its Useless). 

# How To Use My Mods?

You Need To Run The Code On The Boxel 3D Website. How To Do This Is Simple And In The Main Game,There Is A Tutorial On How To Do This:

1: The Best Possible Way Is To Copy Mod Code, Go To The Boxel Website (https://dopplercreative.com/test Is The One I Use), Right Click With Your Mouse, Click Inspect (The Last Option), Go To Console (The Second Option In The Top Right) And Copy-Paste The Modding Api, Put The Mods After And You're Done!

2: Try To Use The Tapermonkey Extention To Run The Mods. Be Sure To Run The Api 1st.

3: Use An Extention That Puts Javascript Into A Web Page Or Similar To That.

If You're Having Problems Running The Mods, Be Sure You Have The Api Running Before The Other Mods. To Be Sure It's Running, You Will See A Very Small Text In The Bottom-Right Of The Screen That Says "Modding Api". Then You Can Run Any Other Mods You Want (1 At A Time Tho).

# How Do I Make My Own Mods?

If You Wanna Create Your Own Mods, Follow These Instructions:

1: Learn How To Use The Mods Correctly And Putting Them In The Game.

2: Learn How To Write Javascript.

3: Try To Look At The Code Of The Other Existing Mods ANd Try To Understand Them.

4: Create Your Own Mod!

5: Don't Use ChatGPT To Write EVERYTHING FOR YOU! Not Cool!
